        <h2>About us as a company <br> From the ripe age of 19, the founder, Jonathan Torres, had an affinity for plants. Starting with a ZZ plant that was gifted to him and he slowly grew his plant collection little by little. However, as he grew his collection he ran into problems: plants weren't responding well after months of trial and error of trying to get the plants to grow, little knowledge on how to take care of certain plants, and even running into trouble with repotting a plant. He went through the struggle so hopefully you don't have to. <br>Now, we're here to help you grow your plant collection to the place you'd like it to be.</h2>
